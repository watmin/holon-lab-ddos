# http-lab Progress

**Status:** All attack types mitigated — GET floods, credential stuffing, scrapers, TLS-randomized floods
**Date:** February 2026
**Latest Update:** February 28, 2026
**Result:** Autonomous L7 WAF with composable rule expression language integrated end-to-end, Rete-spirit DAG compiler achieving sub-microsecond rule evaluation at million-rule scale, dual-tier VSA detection, adaptive TLS rule generation, engram memory with EDN-serialized rules, per-IP rate limiting, best-match specificity evaluator, per-rule counters, and real-time monitoring dashboard
**Key Achievement:** The composable rule language is live — detection generates rules like `(= (first (header "content-type")) "application/json")` and cross-layer TLS+HTTP compound rules automatically. Expression tree evaluation is O(tree depth), not O(rule count). 1M rules evaluate in ~1.1µs to ~2.6µs. Miss path: ~50ns. A single core exceeds 900K evals/sec.

## Overview

L7 WAF lab — HTTP flood DDoS detection and mitigation via TLS-terminating reverse
proxy + holon-rs sidecar running a Rete-spirit rule engine. Mirrors veth-lab structure
and philosophy at Layer 7. Built in three days of after-hours work.

### Phase 1a — Working Proxy (no rules) COMPLETE

- [x] `types.rs` — TlsContext, ConnectionContext, RequestSample, rule types, CompiledTree
- [x] `tls.rs` — Raw ClientHello parser, TlsContext → holon Vector, tokio-rustls handshake
- [x] `http.rs` — Hyper HTTP/1.1 server, upstream forwarding, sample enqueue
- [x] `runner/main.rs` — TLS accept loop, spawns sidecar tasks in-process
- [x] `setup.sh` — start mock backend (python http.server)
- [x] `build.sh` — cargo build wrapper

**Result**: working TLS-terminating reverse proxy that parses ClientHello and logs TlsContext per connection.

### Phase 1b — Detection + Rules COMPLETE

- [x] `tree.rs` — Rete-spirit DAG compiler for HTTP dimensions
- [x] `enforcer.rs` — synchronous rule check via ArcSwap on every request
- [x] `sidecar/detectors.rs` — SubspaceDetector, EngramLibrary wrappers
- [x] `sidecar/detection.rs` — Detection → RuleSpec compilation
- [x] `sidecar/field_tracker.rs` — per-field value tracking with decay
- [x] `sidecar/rule_manager.rs` — upsert, expire, compile, redundancy check, ArcSwap write
- [x] `sidecar/lib.rs` — dual detection loops (TLS + request), ArcSwap wiring
- [x] `sidecar/metrics_server.rs` — axum /metrics + /health
- [x] `runner/main.rs` updated — spawns sidecar tasks, wires ArcSwap + channels

**Result**: proxy detects anomalies and enforces auto-generated rules.

### Phase 1c — Generator + Demo COMPLETE

- [x] `generator/` — scenario-driven HTTP flood with named TLS profiles
- [x] `demo.sh` — end-to-end: warmup → GET flood → calm → detection → mitigation
- [x] `scenarios/ddos-demo.json` — reference scenario file

**Result**: reproducible DDoS detection demo.

### Phase 1d — Rich Data Model + EDN Rules COMPLETE

- [x] `types.rs` — Rich `TlsContext` with named cipher suites, extensions, groups via `tls_names.rs`
- [x] `types.rs` — Rich `RequestSample` with path_parts, query_params, query_flags, header pairs in wire order
- [x] `types.rs` — Walkable implementations for both TlsContext and RequestSample
- [x] `types.rs` — `Predicate` enum uses `String` values (not FNV-1a hashes)
- [x] `types.rs` — `RuleSpec::to_edn_pretty()` and `to_edn_compact()` for human-readable rule output
- [x] `tree.rs` — `TreeNode` HashMap keys changed from `u32` to `String`
- [x] `tls_names.rs` — 100+ cipher suite, 50+ extension, 20+ group name mappings with hex fallback

**Result**: rich, structured data representations that preserve full request fidelity. Human-readable EDN rules like `(= tls-cipher-set "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,...")`.

### Phase 1e — Detection Pipeline Alignment with veth-lab COMPLETE

- [x] Individual sample scoring (no bundling/averaging)
- [x] Hybrid tick trigger: fires on 200 samples OR 500ms (whichever first)
- [x] Per-sample exponential decay (half-life=500 requests)
- [x] Per-tick max-residual tracking drives anomaly decisions
- [x] Two-tier detection: SubspaceDetector anomaly + EngramLibrary fast-path
- [x] `SubspaceDetector::with_subspace_params()` for per-detector tuning
- [x] TLS detector tuned separately: `ema_alpha=0.05` (5x faster), `sigma_mult=2.0` (tighter)
- [x] Baseline RPS tracking during warmup for rate limit calculation
- [x] FieldTracker baseline freezing at warmup completion

**Result**: detection pipeline matches veth-lab's proven approach, adapted for HTTP's different traffic characteristics (per-connection TLS vs per-request HTTP, different sample volumes).

### Phase 1f — Rate Limiting + Engram Memory COMPLETE

- [x] `enforcer.rs` — Per-IP token bucket `RateLimiter` (true rate limiting, not hard block)
- [x] `http.rs` — Integrated rate limiter: check `allow()` before forwarding, 429 on excess
- [x] `lib.rs` — Rate factor calculation: `baseline_rps / estimated_rps` (veth-lab approach)
- [x] `lib.rs` — Engram minting with surprise fingerprint + active rules stored as metadata
- [x] `lib.rs` — Engram deployment: parse stored EDN rules via `parse_edn()`, recalculate rate limits to current baseline
- [x] `lib.rs` — Concentration-based rule generation: `find_concentrated_values(0.5)` replaces raw surprise for REQ rules
- [x] `lib.rs` — FieldTracker baseline freezing: concentrated values during warmup excluded from attack attribution
- [x] Engram persistence: load/save to disk as JSON

**Result**: true per-IP rate limiting (allows baseline RPS, 429s excess). Engram memory enables sub-tick rule deployment on re-detected attacks with dynamically recalculated rate limits.

### Phase 1g — Multi-Attack Scenarios + TLS Randomization COMPLETE

- [x] `scenarios/multi_attack.json` — 15-phase scenario covering 4 attack types + replay waves
- [x] `generator/` — `bot_shuffled` TLS profile: consistent cipher/extension values in random order
- [x] `types.rs` — Set-based TLS fields: `cipher_set_string()`, `ext_set_string()`, `group_set_string()` (sorted, order-independent)
- [x] `types.rs` — New `FieldDim` variants: `TlsCipherSet`, `TlsExtSet`, `TlsGroupSet`
- [x] `lib.rs` — Adaptive ordered-vs-set TLS rule generation via `tls_field_candidates()` + `get_tls_field_top_value()`
- [x] `lib.rs` — Deduplication of TLS constraints (prevents both ordered and set versions of same field)
- [x] `lib.rs` — TLS rules use `RateLimit` action (not `CloseConnection`)
- [x] `detection.rs` — Set-based field mappings in `to_predicate()` and `StoredRule::to_rule_spec()`

**Result**: all attacks mitigated including TLS-randomized floods. The system adaptively selects ordered or set-based constraints based on observed concentration — no hardcoded patterns.

### Phase 1h — Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard COMPLETE

- [x] `metrics_server.rs` — `DashboardEvent` enum (Metrics, RuleEvent, DetectionEvent, Heartbeat)
- [x] `metrics_server.rs` — SSE streaming via `tokio::sync::broadcast`
- [x] `metrics_server.rs` — `/api/rules` endpoint with `RuleSummary` (EDN, action, age)
- [x] `static/dashboard.html` — Real-time UI with SSE auto-reconnect
- [x] Dashboard: uPlot charts for enforcement rates and detection scores vs thresholds
- [x] Dashboard: header metrics (RPS, tick, enforcement counts)
- [x] Dashboard: detection state panel (TLS + REQ scores, thresholds, streaks, engrams)
- [x] Dashboard: active rules panel with EDN display (bounded, scrollable)
- [x] Dashboard: unified event log (bounded, scrollable)
- [x] Dashboard: 120-second time-based timeline window
- [x] `lib.rs` — SSE event emission for rule adds, engram deploys, detections, attacks ending

**Result**: real-time monitoring dashboard at `http://localhost:9090/` showing enforcement, detection, rules, and events.

### Phase 1i — Performance Optimization COMPLETE

- [x] Eliminated 14-second stall caused by `stats.write().await` inside inner drain loop
- [x] Consolidated all stats updates to single lock acquisition after drain
- [x] Drain loop capped at 512 samples per pass
- [x] Sample channel capacity reduced from 4096 to 512 (prevents sidecar lag during rate transitions)
- [x] Generator status code tracking (2xx, 403, 429, other) for accurate load measurement

**Result**: consistent sub-second tick times, no stalls during rule deployment or high traffic.

### Phase 1j — Dashboard UX: DAG Visualization, Legends, Tooltips COMPLETE

- [x] Dashboard: 2/3 + 1/3 grid layout — charts on left, DAG panel spanning both chart rows on right
- [x] Dashboard: uPlot timestamp x-axis and legend overlays with series names, colors, current values
- [x] Dashboard: hover tooltips on chart data points with detailed values
- [x] Dashboard: DAG canvas ported from veth-lab — tree layout, edge rendering, mouse interaction
- [x] Dashboard: bottom row split 1/2 + 1/2 for Active Rules and Event Log panels
- [x] `types.rs` — `CompiledTree::to_dag_nodes()` serializes rule tree into `DagNode`/`DagEdge` structs
- [x] `metrics_server.rs` — `DagSnapshot` SSE event broadcasts tree state on every recompile
- [x] `lib.rs` — `broadcast_dag()` helper + DAG JSON logging to disk for debugging

**Result**: real-time rule tree visualization with interactive tooltips showing node details and ancestry.

### Phase 1k — Tree Compiler Fix + DAG Polish COMPLETE

- [x] `tree.rs` — Fixed combinatorial explosion: wildcard rules no longer duplicated into specific branches (pure DAG, matching veth-lab)
- [x] `types.rs` — Terminal nodes labeled `"terminal"` instead of inheriting last dimension name
- [x] Dashboard: two-pass pruning (dead-end leaf removal + wildcard chain collapse) with post-pruning connectivity check
- [x] Dashboard: terminal nodes rendered as orange diamonds (distinct from circle branch nodes)
- [x] Dashboard: canvas coordinate scaling fix — mouse-to-canvas transform accounts for CSS/buffer size mismatch
- [x] Dashboard: bounding-box hit detection (consistent for all node shapes)
- [x] Dashboard: `buildRuleExpression()` walks ancestry to reconstruct full EDN rule string on terminal tooltips
- [x] Dashboard: pretty-printed Clojure-style EDN rule display in tooltips
- [x] Dashboard: wildcard edges rendered with brighter dashed lines for visibility

**Result**: clean, readable rule tree with proper branching. Terminal tooltips show the full rule in EDN format. Node count reduced from 107 to 42 raw nodes (22 after pruning) for a 6-rule tree.

### Phase 1l — Per-Rule Counters + Legend Polish COMPLETE

- [x] `types.rs` — `evaluate_req`/`evaluate_tls` now return `(action, rule_id)` — rule_id threaded through DFS
- [x] `lib.rs` (proxy) — Global `RULE_COUNTERS` map: `increment_rule_counter(rule_id)` called on every match
- [x] `tree.rs` — `CompiledTree.rule_labels` map populated during compilation: rule_id → (constraints_sexpr, action)
- [x] `metrics_server.rs` — `RuleCounters` SSE event with `Vec<RuleCounter>` (id, label, action, count)
- [x] `lib.rs` (sidecar) — Counter snapshot joined with tree labels, broadcast each tick
- [x] Dashboard: top-5 rules by rate as dashed lines on enforcement chart
- [x] Dashboard: per-rule legend section with constraint label, action badge, rate
- [x] Dashboard: legend names switched to kebab-case (passed, rate-limited, blocked, tls-score, etc.)
- [x] Dashboard: action labels lowercased (rate-limit, block, close, count, pass)
- [x] Dashboard: rule labels show `constraints_sexpr()` only — no `{:constraints ... :actions ...}` wrapper
- [x] Dashboard: legend capped at 75% panel width to keep latest chart data visible
- [x] Dashboard: chart tooltip allows text wrap for long rule expressions

**Result**: per-rule hit counters with real-time rate computation, overlaid as dashed chart series. Full rule expressions visible in legend and tooltip without truncation.

### Phase 1m — Best-Match Evaluator with Specificity Ranking COMPLETE

- [x] `types.rs` — `Specificity` struct with `derive(Ord)`: lexicographic comparison over named fields
- [x] `types.rs` — `FieldDim::is_tls()` / `is_http()` classify constraint dimensions into layers
- [x] `types.rs` — `pick_best()` selects the match with highest `Specificity` (ties go to specific branch)
- [x] `types.rs` — DFS evaluator explores BOTH specific and wildcard branches, picks best globally (mirrors veth-lab's `best_prio` accumulator)
- [x] `tree.rs` — `specificity_score()` computes `Specificity { layers, has_http, constraints }` per terminal
- [x] Previous behavior: `specific.or(wildcard)` — specific branch always shadows wildcard regardless of rule quality
- [x] New behavior: both branches explored, most surgical match wins

Specificity ranking (lexicographic, each field is an independent policy rule):
1. `layers` — cross-layer (TLS+HTTP = 2) > single-layer (1) > unconstrained (0)
2. `has_http` — HTTP constraints more surgical than TLS-only (1 > 0)
3. `constraints` — more constraints = narrower match

**Result**: cross-layer TLS+HTTP rules now correctly beat single-layer TLS-only rules. HTTP-only rules preferred over TLS-only at same constraint count. Adding a new ranking tiebreaker is a one-line field insertion.

### Phase 1n — Composable Rule Expression Language COMPLETE

- [x] `expr.rs` — `RuleExpr` struct: constraints + action + optional comment/label/name fields
- [x] `expr.rs` — `Expr` constraint type: operator + dimension + value (tier-1 tree-native, tier-2 guard predicates)
- [x] `expr.rs` — `Dimension` enum: `Simple(SimpleDim)` + `Header(name)` + `Cookie(name)` + `Query(name)` + composition functions (`First`, `Last`, `Nth`, `Get`, `Key`, `Val`, `Count`, `Keys`, `Vals`, `SetOf`, `Lower`)
- [x] `expr.rs` — `SimpleDim`: 26 field dimensions (11 HTTP + 15 TLS) covering request line, headers, cookies, query params, path parts, TLS scalar/set/list/map fields
- [x] `expr.rs` — `Operator` enum: `Eq`, `Exists`, `Gt`, `Lt`, `Gte`, `Lte`, `Prefix`, `Suffix`, `Contains`, `Regex`, `Not`, `Subset`, `Superset`
- [x] `expr.rs` — `Value` enum: `Str`, `Num`, `Bool`, `List`, `Set`, `Pair`, `Nil` with canonical key rendering
- [x] `expr.rs` — EDN parser (via `edn-rs` crate): full round-trip `parse_rule_edn()` ↔ `to_edn()` / `to_edn_pretty()`
- [x] `expr.rs` — `RuleAction` enum with structured `name: Option<(String, String)>` (namespace, name) for all variants
- [x] `expr.rs` — Dimension extraction: `extract_from_request()` and `extract_from_tls()` resolve full accessor chains against live protocol data
- [x] `docs/RULE-LANGUAGE.md` — full language specification with examples, dimension catalog, operator reference, composition functions

**Result**: Lisp-like composable rule language with EDN serialization. Rules like `(= (first (header "user-agent")) "python-requests/2.31.0")` and `(exists (set (lower (keys query-params))) "debug")` express arbitrary constraints over TLS and HTTP fields. The language is extensible — new dimensions and operators can be added without changing the grammar or tree compiler.

### Phase 1o — Expression Tree Compiler + Sub-Microsecond Evaluation COMPLETE

- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — `ExprCompiledTree`: Rete-spirit DAG compiled from `Vec<RuleExpr>`, one level per constraint dimension
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — Dynamic dimension ordering: `compute_dim_order()` ranks dimensions by rule participation count for optimal branching
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — Dual match modes: `Exact` (single value → HashMap get, O(1)) and `Membership` (collection → iterate + probe, O(|collection|))
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — Guard predicates: tier-2 operators (prefix, suffix, contains, gt/lt, regex, subset/superset) evaluated as post-match filters on terminal nodes
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — Best-match DFS evaluator: explores specific + wildcard branches, selects highest `Specificity`
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — `evaluate_req()` and `evaluate_tls()` for HTTP and TLS-only rule evaluation
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — Zero-clone compilation: borrows rules (`&[&RuleExpr]`) during recursion, `Cow` canonical keys
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — FNV hash-based fingerprint for O(1) tree identity comparison
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — Lazy rule labels: deferred to access time, not computed during compilation
- [x] `proxy/tests/tree_perf.rs` — Comprehensive performance benchmarks: complexity sweep (1–6 dims), scale sweep (100–1M rules), mixed-complexity workload

Performance (release, February 2026):

| Metric | 2-dim @ 1M rules | 6-dim @ 1M rules | Miss (any) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| eval p50 | 1,109 ns | 2,573 ns | ~50 ns |
| evals/sec/core | 900K+ | 390K+ | — |
| compile time | 3.2s | 5.9s | — |

Evaluation is O(tree depth). 100 rules or 1,000,000 — same number of hash lookups. Miss latency is ~50ns regardless of tree size (single hash miss at root). No rule is ever "checked" at runtime — field values navigate directly to the matching terminal. This is fundamentally different from traditional WAF architectures that do O(n) sequential rule evaluation.

**Result**: expression tree achieves constant-time rule evaluation independent of rule count. A 16-core host can evaluate ~6M+ requests/sec against a 100K mixed-complexity rule tree. Fully inline enforcement is viable without sampling — the rule engine is no longer the bottleneck.

### Phase 1p — Expression Tree Integration + Live Detection Pipeline COMPLETE

- [x] `enforcer.rs` — Swapped from `CompiledTree` to `ExprCompiledTree` for both `evaluate()` and `evaluate_tls()`
- [x] `http.rs` — `serve_connection` and `handle_request` now use `Arc<ArcSwap<ExprCompiledTree>>`
- [x] `runner/main.rs` — Initializes `ArcSwap<ExprCompiledTree>::empty()`
- [x] `sidecar/rule_manager.rs` — `RuleManager` stores `RuleExpr`, compiles with `compile_expr()`, deploys to `ArcSwap<ExprCompiledTree>`
- [x] `sidecar/detectors.rs` — `attack_rules` changed from `Vec<RuleSpec>` to `Vec<RuleExpr>`
- [x] `sidecar/lib.rs` — Detection loop uses `compile_compound_rule_expr()`, engram rules serialized/parsed as EDN strings
- [x] `expr_tree.rs` — `to_dag_nodes()` added for DAG visualization, `rule_labels` populated during compilation
- [x] `proxy/benches/tree_perf.rs` — Performance tests moved from `tests/` to `benches/` for on-demand invocation
- [x] All 287 tests passing (237 proxy + 42 sidecar + 8 integration)
- [x] Live validation: multi-attack scenario produces composable rules with accessor chains, TLS set matching, cross-layer compound rules

Live-generated rules from the detection pipeline (first time the composable language was exercised end-to-end):

```clojure
;; HTTP path concentration
{:constraints [(= path "/api/search")] :actions [(rate-limit 83)]}

;; TLS fingerprint (set-based, order-independent)
{:constraints [(= tls-ext-types #{"0x0000" "0x0005" ...})
               (= tls-ciphers #{"0x00ff" "0x1301" ...})
               (= tls-groups #{"0x0017" "0x0018" "0x001d"})]
 :actions [(rate-limit 83)]}

;; Composable accessor chain — first value of Content-Type header
{:constraints [(= path "/api/v1/auth/login")
               (= method "POST")
               (= (first (header "content-type")) "application/json")]
 :actions [(rate-limit 83)]}

;; Cross-layer HTTP+TLS — compound rule spanning both protocol layers
{:constraints [(= method "POST")
               (= (first (header "content-type")) "application/json")
               (= tls-ext-types #{"0x0000" "0x0005" ...})]
 :actions [(rate-limit 83)]}
```

The system now produces complementary layered rules: an HTTP-path rule catches the attack at the endpoint level, while a cross-layer HTTP+TLS rule catches the attacker by their TLS fingerprint regardless of which endpoint they target. The redundancy checker correctly allows both because neither subsumes the other — they defend different attack surfaces with the same composable language.

**Result**: the full pipeline from anomaly detection through rule generation to sub-microsecond enforcement now speaks the composable expression language. Legacy `RuleSpec`/`CompiledTree` types remain in the codebase but are no longer in the live path. The only remaining gap is `FieldTracker` coverage — expanding the tracked fields unlocks all 26+ dimensions the language already supports.

## Key Decisions

### 2026-02-23

- Same-process architecture (sidecar is a lib, proxy binary owns everything via `runner` crate)
- Full ClientHello parser from day one — parse raw bytes before handing to rustls
- TlsContext (not "fingerprint") — lossless, ordered, raw extension bytes preserved
- RequestSample headers: Vec<(String,String)> — wire order, duplicates preserved
- Proxy always acts synchronously (ArcSwap::load); sidecar enqueue is try_send (drop on full)
- Body inspection deferred to phase 2
- `runner` crate added as binary to avoid circular dep: proxy lib ← sidecar lib ← runner bin

### 2026-02-24

- Switched from FNV-1a hashes to String keys in Predicate/TreeNode — HTTP is clear-text, readability matters
- EDN syntax for rules (matching veth-lab) — `(= path-prefix "/api/search")` instead of opaque hashes
- Individual sample scoring (not bundled/averaged) — aligned with veth-lab's proven approach
- Concentration-based field attribution — surprise alone produces overly specific rules, concentration identifies the dominant signal
- TLS detector gets separate tuning params — lower sample volume needs faster convergence and tighter thresholds
- `baseline_rps` tracked during warmup — used as the anchor for rate limit calculations
- FieldTracker baseline freeze — prevents flagging always-dominant values during attacks
- Per-IP token bucket for true rate limiting — allows baseline rate through, 429s excess

### 2026-02-25

- Stall root cause identified as `RwLock` contention in drain loop — moved stats writes outside hot path
- SSE dashboard architecture — broadcast channel for fan-out, no polling overhead
- Detection state split into TLS and REQ panels in dashboard
- Time-based timeline trimming (120s window) instead of fixed point count

### 2026-02-26

- Set-based TLS fields (cipher_set, ext_set, group_set) for order-independent detection
- Adaptive ordered-vs-set selection: check concentration of ordered version first, fall back to set
- Deduplication of TLS constraints — prevents conflicting AND conditions in compound rules
- TLS rules switched from CloseConnection to RateLimit — rate limiting is more proportional
- TLS_FIELDS aligned with actual Walkable field names — surprise fingerprint was attributing to wrong fields

### 2026-02-26 (continued — DAG + Dashboard)

- Dashboard layout: single DAG panel spanning both chart rows (not per-chart) — gives tree more vertical space
- Tree compiler pure DAG: specific branches only get their own rules, wildcard branches only get wildcard rules — no cross-product explosion
- Terminal node labeling: action-bearing leaf nodes labeled "terminal" not "content-type" — prevents confusion in DAG visualization
- Canvas coordinate scaling: mouse events must transform CSS→buffer space to handle panel resize drift
- Rule expression reconstruction: walk from terminal to root collecting specific edge constraints — matches veth-lab's `buildRepresentativeConstraints`
- Per-sample processing: ~0.4ms amortized (encode_walkable + CCIPCA score + field tracker), ~2,500 samples/s single-threaded throughput

### 2026-02-26 (continued — Rule Counters + Specificity)

- Per-rule counter map uses `Mutex<HashMap<u32, u64>>` — incremented on every rule match, snapshotted + broadcast each tick
- Rule labels use `constraints_sexpr()` (constraint array only) instead of full EDN with `{:constraints ... :actions ...}` — less noise in legend
- Legend capped at 75% width — prevents overlapping live chart data where latest values are most important
- Best-match evaluator: DFS explores both specific AND wildcard branches, `pick_best` selects highest `Specificity`
- `Specificity` struct with derived `Ord` replaces ad-hoc numeric formula (`layers*100 + has_http*10 + cc`) — lexicographic comparison is robust to new tiebreakers
- Tiebreaker design: `(layers, has_http, constraints)` — each field is independently motivated, not entangled by arithmetic
- Cross-layer (TLS+HTTP) rules: 2 layers always beats 1 layer, regardless of constraint count — cross-layer correlation is the strongest signal
- HTTP > TLS tiebreaker: at same layer count, HTTP constraints (path, method, UA) are more actionable than TLS-only

### 2026-02-27 / 2026-02-28 (Rule Language + Expression Tree)

- Composable rule language over EDN — Clojure-like s-expressions, not a custom DSL. Rules are data.
- `edn-rs` crate for parsing instead of hand-rolled parser — veth-lab parity, standard format
- Dimension accessor chains (`(first (header "user-agent"))`) compose generically — no magic named headers
- `Value::Set` uses a proper set type with quoted string elements in EDN serialization — not comma-delimited strings
- `RuleAction` and `RuleExpr` parity with veth-lab: structured names `(namespace, name)`, optional comment/label
- `RateLimit` period extensibility deferred — current structure supports `(rate-limit (period (minutes 5)) 300)` as additive future work
- Tree compiler zero-clone: `&[&RuleExpr]` slices through recursion instead of deep-cloning `RuleExpr` vecs at each level
- `canonical_key_cow()` returns `Cow<'_, str>` for zero-alloc grouping on the hot path
- `compute_dim_order` simplified to rule-count-per-dimension instead of unique-value-set collection — eliminates million-entry HashMaps
- Hash-based fingerprint (FNV over sorted rule identity hashes) instead of string concatenation — O(n) instead of O(n log n) with less allocation
- Lazy rule labels — only materialized when the dashboard requests them, not during compilation of 1M rules that may never be displayed

### 2026-02-28 (Expression Tree Integration)

- Full pipeline swap from `RuleSpec`/`CompiledTree` to `RuleExpr`/`ExprCompiledTree` — detection through enforcement
- Engram rules serialized as EDN strings instead of JSON structs — human-readable, round-trip stable via `parse_edn()` / `to_edn()`
- Performance benchmarks moved from `tests/` to `benches/` — `cargo test` stays fast, `cargo bench` for on-demand profiling
- Cross-layer compound rules emerge naturally: REQ detector and TLS detector independently generate complementary rules in the same attack
- Redundancy checker correctly allows complementary rules: `path + method + content-type` and `method + content-type + tls-ext-types` target different surfaces
- Legacy types (`RuleSpec`, `CompiledTree`, `tree.rs`) retained but no longer in live path — available for reference/comparison

## Performance Observations

- Python mock backend is the throughput bottleneck — proxy serves 429s much faster than forwarding to origin (Rust vs Python, expected)
- During non-attack periods, RPS is choppy (~100) limited by backend. During mitigated attacks, proxy handles 1000+ rps easily since most are 429s
- Sample channel capacity of 512 balances sidecar responsiveness vs sample coverage during burst transitions
- Tick time consistently <100ms even at 2000 rps attack load (after stall fixes)
- Engram re-detection deploys rules in 1 tick vs 3+ ticks for first-time detection
- Per-sample processing: ~0.4ms (encode_walkable ~0.2ms, CCIPCA score ~0.05ms, field tracking ~0.05ms, overhead ~0.1ms)
- Theoretical inline WAF throughput: ~2,800 RPS/core, ~45K RPS on 16 cores (score + enforce are read-only, scale linearly)
- **Rule evaluation is scale-independent**: 1M rules evaluate in ~1.1µs (2-dim) to ~2.6µs (6-dim). Cost is O(tree depth), not O(rule count). 10,000x more rules adds <2x latency.
- **Miss path is ~50ns**: a non-matching request does one hash miss at the root and returns. No rules consulted.
- **Compilation scales linearly**: 1M 2-dim rules compile in 3.2s, 6-dim in 5.9s. In practice, attack waves produce tens of rules — sub-millisecond compilation.
- **Mixed-complexity realistic workload**: 100K rules with distribution from 1-dim to 6-dim, all p50 evals under 2.4µs, 100% correctness across all tiers.
- **Single-core rule evaluation throughput**: 900K+ evals/sec (2-dim), 556K+ (6-dim). On 16 cores: ~6M+ evals/sec for mixed workloads — rule engine is not the bottleneck.

## Resolved Questions

- **Rate-limit granularity**: Per-IP with dynamic RPS based on baseline. Works well — different IPs get independent buckets.
- **Warmup duration**: 500 REQ samples (20-30s at 80 rps baseline). Sufficient for HTTP traffic diversity.
- **ArcSwap vs RwLock**: ArcSwap confirmed as correct choice. RwLock in the stats path caused the only serious performance regression.

## Open Questions

- Query string structure for detection — how to handle malformed/double query strings as attack signals?
- Path ngram analysis — path_parts are captured but not yet used for detection dimensions
- Header ordering as detection signal — captured in RequestSample but not yet encoded into detection fields
- Connection-level metrics (requests per connection, connection duration) for slow-loris type attacks

## Phase 2 (Future)

- Body inspection (streaming windowed VSA, PayloadSubspaceDetector)
- Exploit detection: SQLi, XSS, path traversal
- Connection RST via SO_LINGER
- JA4 string output for external tool correlation
- XDP integration for kernel-level enforcement (shared rule tree with veth-lab)
- Path ngram dimensions for directory traversal / enumeration detection
- Header ordering dimension for HTTP fingerprinting
- Geo-IP integration for geographic anomaly detection
- Rule confidence scoring and automatic threshold adjustment
